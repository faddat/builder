# Architecture Independent Mattermost Builder

Dockerfile for a docker image that can be used to build Mattermost regardless of the CPU architecture.  Not Used in the offical Mattermost x86/AMD64 travis CI build system.  See the mattermost/platform Makefile and .travis.yml for more details.

Here you go folks, an ARM-based builder for a leading Open Source web chat platform!

# Note
For the time being this is just something I put together, nothing more.  Please, tell me how it worked for you, though!
